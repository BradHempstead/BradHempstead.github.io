Initial post for Macro Keypad Project (beetter name pending) I am in the planning stages for, this project is planned to test, improve and practice my Hardware design and construction skills as well as improve my microcontroller usage and understanding, using a final product that will likely see usage daily to help improve my workflow, in order to judge its quality and the various implementations used to be correct and functional.

Current tasks so far for the project include:
- [ ] Parts list
- [ ] Hardware Design
    - [ ] Circuit Design
    - [ ] PCB Design
    - [ ] Case Design
- [ ] Software selection
